# Learnathon4.0
A machine learning project to predict the likelihood of hospital readmission for patients with chronic conditions using clinical and admission data. Built using Python, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, and Streamlit, this project delivers real-time predictions and actionable KPI insights for healthcare providers.

Project Overview
Hospital readmissions are a significant challenge in modern healthcare, especially for patients with chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension. Unplanned readmissions lead to increased healthcare costs and strain on medical resources.

This project aims to predict the risk of patient readmission using historical hospital data and engineered Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as Length of Stay (LOS) and Weekend Admission flags. By leveraging machine learning models (RandomForest, Logistic Regression, and LightGBM), the system provides accurate, explainable predictions and identifies the factors driving high readmission risk.

A Streamlit web application is developed for real-time prediction, allowing healthcare staff to input patient details and instantly receive readmission risk assessments. The solution enhances hospital decision-making, reduces preventable readmissions, and supports proactive patient care.
